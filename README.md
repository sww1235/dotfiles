# dotfiles
my dotfiles

remember to clone with `--recurse-submodules -j8` to download vim packages


## NOTES

nvidia directory is copied from https://github.com/TheEdward162/dotfiles
so I can get nvidia cards working in void linux

## VIM specifics

use `.vim/after/` directory to not override defaults for things like filetype plugins etc
